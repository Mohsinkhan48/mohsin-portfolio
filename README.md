**React.js Developer**
I’m Muhammad Mohsin Khan, a Junior Software Engineer with two years of experience in React.js development.

🚀I am excited to share my **portfolio website**, which I built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and primarily React.js. 🚀

This project has significantly contributed to my learning and skill development in web development.🚀

This project was completed six months ago. Since then, I have been working on multiple other projects and look forward to sharing them soon.🌟

**👨‍💻 Through this project, I have gained:**

1): HTML Proficiency: Knowledge of how to use various HTML tags to structure web content effectively.

2): CSS Skills: Understanding of how to use CSS classes and IDs to style web pages and create visually appealing layouts.

3): JavaScript Expertise: Enhanced understanding of JavaScript concepts and how to use them to add interactivity to web pages.

4): React.js :
Using props to pass data between components.
Writing JSX to create React elements.
Fetching and managing data in a React application.
Handling component state and lifecycle methods.

This project has been a significant step in my journey as a web developer, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting and gain hands-on experience with modern web technologies.📧 📧
